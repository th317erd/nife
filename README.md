Misc javascript utilities

This is a collection of standard generic utilities for javascript.

This modules contains utilities like deep object merging, capitalizing strings, plucking objects from an array, fetching and setting object properties based on property path (deep), etc...

Check the unit tests on github for examples on how to use these methods (until better documentation can be written).
